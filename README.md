# Integrated Reservoir Sedimentation Prediction (IRSP) Model

## Overview

The **Integrated Reservoir Sedimentation Prediction (IRSP)** model is an innovative approach that combines machine learning with physical models to estimate **Reservoir Sedimentation Rates (RSR)** across the globe. This model incorporates geographical, environmental, and reservoir-specific variables to provide accurate RSR estimates for reservoirs worldwide.

Sediment accumulation in reservoirs is a global issue that steadily reduces their storage capacity. Accurately quantifying RSR is crucial for developing effective sediment management strategies. However, significant gaps in RSR data, such as limited spatial coverage and inconsistent data quality, have hindered progress. The IRSP model addresses these challenges by providing a reliable, global dataset of RSRs.

## Installation

To run the IRSP model, you need Python installed along with the dependencies listed below. You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow (for deep learning models, if used)
matplotlib (for visualizations)
seaborn (for visualizations)
geopy (for geographical calculations)


##Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/irsp-model.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd irsp-model
Run the model: To train the model and generate predictions, execute the following script:
python run_model.py
This will:
Load training data.
Train the model using machine learning techniques.
Output predictions for sedimentation rates for each reservoir.
If you want to test the model on a new dataset, you can replace the train_data.csv with a new dataset.


import pandas as pd
from model import IRSPModel

# Load your dataset (e.g., train_data.csv)
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Instantiate the model
model = IRSPModel()

# Predict you data
predictions = model.predict(data)

# Save the results to a CSV file
predictions.to_csv('predicted_rsr.csv', index=False)
