# Integrated Reservoir Sedimentation Prediction (IRSP) Model

## Overview

The **Integrated Reservoir Sedimentation Prediction (IRSP)** model is an innovative approach that combines machine learning with physical models to estimate **Reservoir Sedimentation Rates (RSR)** across the globe. This model incorporates geographical, environmental, and reservoir-specific variables to provide accurate RSR estimates for reservoirs worldwide.

Sediment accumulation in reservoirs is a global issue that steadily reduces their storage capacity. Accurately quantifying RSR is crucial for developing effective sediment management strategies. However, significant gaps in RSR data, such as limited spatial coverage and inconsistent data quality, have hindered progress. The IRSP model addresses these challenges by providing a reliable, global dataset of RSRs.

## Installation

To run the IRSP model, you need Python installed along with the dependencies listed below. You can install the required libraries by running:
